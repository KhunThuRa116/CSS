                    Umibudou literally translates as "Sea Grapes." It's a kind of seaweed
                     but instead of leaves it has little bubbles growing on its stems. 
                     Thus the serving looks like small, green grapes. <br><br> 
                     The bubbles break on 
                     your tongue and release a slightly salty taste of pure Southern Sea freshness.
                     It is more delicious when you are eating with some kind of japanese soysauce.

                    Usually, the word soba refers to buckwheat noodle dishes in Japan. 
                    However, in Okinawa, this kind of soba is not very popular and called as Japanese soba or black soba.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Okinawa Soba is reminiscent of ramen and consists of thick wheat noodles in a flavorful broth.
                    The broth is traditionally made with an edible seaweed called konbu, bonito flakes, and pork.

                    The word champuru refers to something being "mixed up" in the Okinawan language. 
                    Goya is the Japanese word for bitter gourd, which is a vegetable used often in Okinawa dishes. <br><br>
                    Goya champuru is an Okinawan stir fry. The traditional base consists of egg, tofu, goya and also some form of meat, often pork belly or SPAM meat. 
                    Champuru is often used in Okinawan households as a way to use leftover vegetables and meat

                    The coconut crab isn't technically a crab, but it belongs to the hermit crab family of decapod crustaceans. They have an average body length of 40 cm and weigh around 4 kg. 
                    They're generally found on Miyako Island in Okinawa. As it's designated as a protected species because of its decreased numbers, the coconut crab is a rare delicacy available only in Okinawa.  <br><br>
                    Most restaurants serve the entire crab boiled, with a hammer to help you crack open its hard shell. Try it with sweetened vinegar (amazu) or soy sauce. The meat tastes like crab or shrimp, with its shell stuffed with richly-flavoured innards.

                    Hirayachi is a savory pancake unique to Okinawa. It has a base consisting of eggs, flour, salt, black pepper and green onion,
                    and can be eaten without seasoning or dipped in a sauce made of soy sauce, vinegar, and sesame oil. <br><br>
                    Hirayachi is a traditional emergency food in Okinawa. In many remote areas, bad weather can still cause power outages; 
                    Hirayachi can easily be made on a portable gas stove with ingredients everyone usually has on hand.

                    Rafute is a local dish of salty-sweet pork belly simmered with bonito stock and strong Okinawan liquor (awamori), seasoned with soy sauce. 
                    Highly popular as a preserved food during the Ryukyu Dynasty, it’s also an important dish at banquets and during Hoji, a Buddhist memorial service in Japan. <br><br>
                    Unlike Okinawa’s braised pork belly (buta no kakuni), which is skinned before cooking, rafute is cooked with the skin left on. 
                    Rafute is gently braised for several hours, producing meat so tender you can easily cut it with chopsticks. 
                    This is a popular dish enjoyed in casual restaurants and Japanese-style pubs all over Okinawa.

                    Okinawa is the hottest place in Japan––even in winter, it rarely drops below 15°C. 
                    Ice cream shops can be found everywhere with some carrying flavors unique to Okinawa. <br><br>
                    Blue Seal is Okinawa's most popular ice cream brand. These days, 
                    Blue Seal shops can be found all over Japan, offering Okinawan flavors such as shikuwasa, 
                    purple sweet potato and salt cookies.
