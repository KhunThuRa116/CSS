                    <p>Okinawa was once an independent country which was ruled by the Ryukyu Kingdom, and flourished
                        through trade with China - the largest country in Asia - as well as other neighboring countries.
                        After the invasion of Satsuma in 1609, Ryukyu became a part of Japanâ€™s shogunate system. It
                        became a prefecture of Japan due to the Abolition of the Han System and Establishment of the
                        Prefecture System, which occurred in 1879.</p>
    
                    <p>During the Pacific War, Okinawa was the site of the only land battle in Japan that involved
                        civilians. After the war, Okinawa was placed under the administration of the United States. In
                        1972, however, Okinawa was returned to Japanese administration. Okinawa remains under Japanese
                        administration today.</p>

                    <p>Okinawa soba is a type of noodle produced in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. Okinawa soba is a
                        regional collective trademark of The Okinawa Noodle Manufacturing Co-op. On Okinawa, it is
                        sometimes simply called soba, although this Japanese term typically refers to buckwheat noodles
                        in mainland Japan.<br><br>
